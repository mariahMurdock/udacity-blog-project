    <p>What When Where is a personal style blog based in Portland, Oregon focused on <b>affordable</b>, <b>attainable</b> style for the <b>everyday</b> woman.</p>
    <p>Hi, I’m Mariah! I’m 25 years old, and I live in Portland, OR. with my partner, Alex. I started this blog in <u>September 22nd of 2020</u> as a fun project to submit for my Udacity Program. I’ve always been a sucker for a great deal, and a sale
      shopper as long as I can remember! So naturally, I love finding & sharing great deals with everyone. As well as staple, <i>worth-every-penny</i> pieces! I’m drawn to everyday, cute, comfortable items. I hope that this creative project for me can
      be a source of inspiration and a fun pastime for my readers!</p>
